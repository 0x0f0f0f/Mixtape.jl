_Mixtape.jl_ currently is a minimal re-implementation of contextual dispatch using `IRTools.jl`.

HOWEVER, _Mixtape.jl_ will be a minimal re-implementation of contextual dispatch using the new `AbstractInterpreter` infrastructure in Julia 1.6.

This work is experimental, based on work put together in [Compiler3](https://github.com/Keno/Compiler3.jl), and mainly cobbled/hacked together using the work found in the downstream integration of [GPUCompiler](https://github.com/Keno/Compiler3.jl/tree/master/dependents/GPUCompiler).
